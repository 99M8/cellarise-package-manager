It is a self-sufficient component but its methods are also mixable into other components.\n\n## Methods\n\n`load(path, cb, [handlers], include_local)`\n\nanalyzes a given directory against a set of handlers, and/or contents of the handlers configuration.\n\nthe included unit test, loader, is a basic scanner that recursively looks for and returns a list of all\nfiles matching a given type.\n\nNote that the default context for the `response()` method of all handlers is the loader component. However,\nby setting the target parameter of the handler, you can manually determine the \"this\" context of a given\nhandler. (that is how all the files of the recursive file scanner are dumped to the root.)\n\nthe `handles()` method, on the other hand, is always contextualized to the handler itself.\n\n",
